# Welcome to the 0bsNetwork Developer Hub

You'll find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you start working with the 0bsnetwork as quickly as possible, as well as support if you get stuck. Let's jump right in!

This developer site is written with the "Dev Without Blockchain Experience" in mind who just wants to get started without learning blockchain inside out, lots of information is ommitted where it wont benefit the initial development flow, and instructions or examples are straight to the point.

You shouldn't need to do much blockchain research before diving in, and our tools are standard tools that you will already be familiar with. We support enough languages and platforms for most developers to be able to get stuck in straight away and learn the blockchain parts as you go. You dont always need to know the minute cryptographic details of every operation so we have mostly left this information out, however it is available should you need it!

Experienced blockchain developers can jump right to the relevant section, the below links may help.

For non-developers / non-technial, or if you want more info about the network, governance, staking or features, please visit our website or docs site here; https://docs.0bsnetwork.com/
