## Full Node Operation

There are various ways and reasons to run a full node, however here lets just concentrate on setting one up for development purposes. You can find more details on more permanent methods, or staking on our main website.

The quick start steps to get up and running on testnet are as follows;

- ```sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk```
- download the jar file and zbs-testnet.conf from here for the latest release; https://github.com/0bsnetwork/Zbs/releases
- ``` java -jar zbs-all-x.x.x-jar zbs-testnet.conf

This will fire up a node in a window. Follow instructions in [Full Node API](nodeapi.md) to enable the API.

We have also made a video on Testnet Node installation and setup under Debian-based GNU/Linux:
